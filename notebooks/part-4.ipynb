    "## Work Log\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction.\n",
    "This part focused on expanding the dataset window (Elhub 2021–2024 + ERA5), reshaping the Streamlit app for clearer navigation, and adding analysis pages that connect meteorology with energy. The app now has four logical sections (Exploration, Regional & Local, Modelling, Quality & Diagnostics), more descriptive page names, and cross-links for a smoother workflow. Heavy operations are cached and show progress indicators. Below is a concise record of what was implemented and refined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark vs. Cassandra Driver\n",
    "\t•\tFollowed the assignment scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tProduction: PRODUCTION_PER_GROUP_MBA_HOUR for 2022–2024 (all price areas).\n",
    "\t•\tConsumption: CONSUMPTION_PER_GROUP_MBA_HOUR for 2021–2024 (all price areas).\n",
    "\t•\tAPI fetching mirrors Part 2 (monthly paging), expanded across years and areas.\n",
    "\t•\tSpark + Cassandra: despite working Spark sessions (connector 3.5.1 variants, shaded/non-shaded JARs, Java 11), the JVM stack intermittently failed to create CqlSession / see the system keyspace reliably in this environment.\n",
    "\t•\tPer course guidance, switched writes to the official Python Cassandra driver (idempotent bulk upserts).\n",
    "MongoDB writes use bulk upserts + compound unique indexes so the notebook is re-runnable without duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### App structure, naming & navigation\n",
    "\t•\tRenamed pages to clearer, more descriptive titles.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t•\tIntroduced four sidebar sections that match the app’s structure:\n",
    "\t•\t🔎 Exploration\n",
    "\t•\t🗺️ Regional & Local\n",
    "\t•\t📈 Modelling\n",
    "\t•\t🧪 Quality & Diagnostics\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t•\tHome and About mirror these sections with concise descriptions and links.\t\n",
    "\t•\tCross-page links where it helps the flow (Price Areas Map → Snow Drift after a map click).\n",
    "\t•\tKept the global Price Area / Year context (set on Price Area Selector) and tiny “Change area/year” links on analysis pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration\n",
    "\t•\tWeather Overview — Stats & Sparklines\n",
    "\t•\tWhole-year summary table (min/mean/max) + first-month sparkline per variable.\n",
    "\t•\tAdded: monthly climatology by year for each weather variable.\n",
    "\t•\tAdded: for wind direction, reused the wind-rose component from Snow Drift so directionality is visualized.\n",
    "\t•\tRemoved the old generic “interactive chart” (now covered—better—by the Weather Explorer page).\n",
    "\t•\tData from Open-Meteo (ERA5), cached.\n",
    "\t•\tWeather Explorer — Multi-Series & Resampling\n",
    "\t•\tMulti-select variables, interactive Plotly, and legend/hover.\n",
    "\t•\tImproved: resample (H/D/W), smooth (rolling mean), and a month range filter for quick seasonal zoom-ins.\n",
    "\t•\tData from Open-Meteo (ERA5), cached.\n",
    "\t•\tEnergy Production / Energy Consumption\n",
    "\t•\tOverview line charts and basic summaries using MongoDB aggregates, respects global Area/Year.\n",

    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regional & Local\n",
    "\t•\tPrice Areas Map — Choropleth & Click-to-Select\n",
    "\t•\tLoads exported Elspot areas (GeoJSON), auto-detects the property holding NO1–NO5, draws outlines, highlights the selected area, and colors a choropleth by mean kWh over user-selected interval/group (production or consumption).\n",
    "\t•\tClick-to-store coordinate in session state; shows a quick link to Snow Drift for that point.\n",
    "\t•\tSnow Drift (Tabler)\n",
    "\t•\tUses ERA5 at the clicked coordinate. Season defined as 1 July → 30 June.\n",
    "\t•\tComputes Qt per season, shows a 16-sector wind rose, and includes the bonus: monthly Qt vs. yearly Qt overlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tAdded an optional fence-height calculator (Wyoming / Slat-and-wire / Solid). To make the snow‐drift results actionable, given the estimated annual transport Q_t, the calculator converts that into the required fence height for common designs (Wyoming, Slat-and-wire, Solid) using their storage capacity factors. It shows how different fence types change the needed height, linking the analysis to a practical mitigation choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",

    "### Modelling\n",
    "\t•\tSliding Correlation (Weather ↔ Energy)\n",
    "\t•\tSelect meteorological and energy series, lag (lead/lag interpretation) and window length, frequency, and date span.\n",
    "\t•\tPlotly rolling correlation line with hover, used to explore correlation shifts during normal periods vs. extreme events (see below).\n",
    "\t•\tSARIMAX Forecast (Energy)\n",
    "\t•\tFull control of (p,d,q)(P,D,Q,s), training window, forecast horizon, and dynamic in-sample forecasting (with a percentage dynamic start).\n",
    "\t•\tBonus completed: exogenous weather variables selectable; future exog generated via “last” or “hour-of-day/day-of-week mean” strategies.\n",
    "\t•\tPlots actuals, fitted (in-sample), forecast mean, and 95% CI.\n",

    "####  Scenario 1 - Consumption → household vs temperature_2m (°C) (NO1, Jan-2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup\n",
    "\t•\tConsumption → household vs temperature_2m (°C)\n",
    "\t•\tWindow length 168 h (1 week), lag 0 h.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe rolling correlation stays negative most of the month (≈ −0.6 to −0.3), dipping to around −0.8 mid/late January during the cold spell.\n",
    "\t•\tOn the overlay, consumption spikes when temperature drops, and eases as temperatures rise—clear winter heating behavior.\n",
    "\t•\tNudging the lag a few hours (±6 h) didn’t flip the sign and only slightly changed magnitude, suggesting near-immediate response of household demand to temperature (little delay).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "In normal winter conditions, household demand is strongly inversely related to temperature—colder → more kWh. As the month warms toward the end, the correlation weakens toward zero, likely as temperature variance shrinks and weekday/behavioral patterns contribute more to demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 2 — Wind production vs. wind speed (NO1, Oct-2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tEnergy kind: Production → group wind\n",
    "\t•\tWeather variable: wind_speed_10m (m/s)\n",
    "\t•\tWindow: 168 h (1 week)\n",
    "\t•\tLag: +1 h (weather leads production by ~1 hour)\n",
    "\n",
    "What I saw\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe rolling correlation starts high and positive (~0.6–0.7) in early October, consistent with wind speed driving wind output.\n",
    "\t•\tAround Oct 18–21, correlation drops toward 0 and briefly negative, then rebounds to ~0.5–0.6.\n",
    "\t•\tThe +1 h lag slightly improved the positive segments versus 0 h, suggesting a short response delay from wind to generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "Strong positive r is expected (more wind → more production). The mid-month dip likely reflects anomalous periods: calm spells or very high winds causing turbine cut-outs where speed no longer maps linearly to output Weekly window balances noise and responsiveness, shorter windows (72 h) made the drop sharper, while longer (336 h) smoothed it but hid the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality & Diagnostics\n",
    "\t•\tTime-Series Analysis — STL Decomposition & Spectrogram\n",
    "\t•\tSTL seasonal/trend decomposition and STFT spectrogram (with clearer spacing/labels).\n",
    "\t•\tSupports both production and consumption after refactor.\n",
    "\t•\tData Quality — SPC (Outliers) & LOF (Anomalies)\n",
    "\t•\tSPC-style control bands and Local Outlier Factor highlights: explanatory captions and consistent titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching & UX\n",
    "\t•\tHeavy data paths use @st.cache_data (ERA5 loaders, energy spans, some Mongo aggregates).\n",
    "\t•\tSpinners/progress on costly steps (data fetch, model fit) so waiting time is visible.\n",
    "\t•\tThe result: pages stay responsive.\n",
